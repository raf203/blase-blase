# Blase Blase

### Project Requirements

- We are task to build a web application that.
  use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
- The application should be deployed to GitHub Pages. It should be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
- We are asked to use at least two server-side APIs.
- We should not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
- The application should have client-side storage to store persistent data, be responsive and have a polished UI/User Interface.
- It should have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
- The application should have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Built with:

- HTML - We used to layout the interface of the website with a touch of Bootstrap.
- CSS - We used to style the website, like colors, margins, paddings and adjusting the designs for the application.
- Javascript - We used this language to manipulate the inputs, data to display and supports the HTML and CSS functionalities.
- Third party API - We used this source to retrieved data and informations about our website.
- Bootstrap/Mediaqueries - We used this CDN to help us build a responsive design.
- Git/Github - We used this application to work together or collaborate in build this project.
